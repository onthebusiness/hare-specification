\begin{abstract}

This document specifies the semantics and behavior of the Hare programming
language and serves to inform the development of compilers and programs for its
use.

The scope of this document only covers the language itself (its grammar
and semantics). The document does not specify any parts of the runtime library,
nor does it specify additional details of the environment or the programming
libraries available in that environment.

This specification is a \textbf{DRAFT}, and is not considered authoritative.
Revisions to this draft are developed under the direction of the Hare project
on SourceHut at \url{https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare}, and the final specification
will be published there as well. You may also contact the editor via email to
Drew DeVault <sir@cmpwn.com>.
