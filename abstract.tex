\begin{abstract}

This document specifies the semantics and behavior of the Hare programming
language and serves to inform the development of compilers and programs for its
use.

The scope of this document covers the language itself (its grammar and
semantics), as well as standard library types \& functions which are necessary
for all Hare environments to provide. The document does not specify any
additional details of the environment or the programming libraries available in
that environment.

This specification is a \textbf{DRAFT}, and is not considered authoritative.
Revisions to this draft are developed under the direction of the Hare project
on SourceHut at \url{https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare}, and the final specification
shall be published there as well. You may also contact the editor via email to
Drew DeVault <sir@cmpwn.com>.
